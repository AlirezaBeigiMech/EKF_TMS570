# EKF_TMS570


In this project, we implemented the Extended kalman filter for IMU. This code is based on TMS570 launchpad and can be used for Attitude and Heading Reference Systems (AHRS). 
The main code is in source/sys_main.c and we only used DSPLIB for calculation of matrices. This algorithm is implemented based on this python library.
